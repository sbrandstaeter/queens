    r"""Multivariate Gaussian Mixture likelihood model.

    Used as a basic test function for MCMC and SMC methods.

    The log likelihood is defined as (see [2]):

    :math:`f({x}) =\log \left( w_1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 \pi)^k |\Sigma_1|}}
    \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu_1)^T\Sigma_1^{-1}(x-\mu_1) \right]+ w_2
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 \pi)^k |\Sigma_2|}}
    \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu_2)^T\Sigma_2^{-1}(x-\mu_2) \right] \right)`

    Returns:
        numpy.array: The logpdf evaluated at *x*
