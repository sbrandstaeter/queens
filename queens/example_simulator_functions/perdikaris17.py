def perdikaris17_lofi(x):
    r"""Low-fidelity version of simple 1D test function.

    Low-fidelity version of a simple 1-dimensional benchmark function as
    proposed in [1] and defined as:

    :math:`f_{lofi}({\bf x}) = \sin(8.0\pi x)`

    The high-fidelity version of the function was also proposed in [1]
    and is in implemented in *perdikaris_1dsin_hifi*.

    Args:
        x (float): Input parameter

    Returns:
        float: Value of function at *x*
