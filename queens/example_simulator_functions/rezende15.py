    The unnormalized probabilistic model used is proportional to
    :math:`p(\theta)\propto \exp(-U(\theta))`
    where :math:`U(\theta)` is a potential. Hence the `log_posterior_unnormalized` is given by
    :math:`-U(\theta)`.

        x (np.ndarray): Samples at which to evaluate the potential (2 :math:`\times` n_samples)
