    Attributes:
        algorithm (str): String that defines the optimization algorithm to be used:

                         - CG: Conjugate gradient optimization (unconstrained), using Jacobian
                         - BFGS: Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (quasi-Newton) for
                                optimization (iterative method for unconstrained
                                nonlinear optimization), using Jacobian
                         - L-BFGS-B: Limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm
                                     with box constraints (for large number of variables)
                         - TNC: Truncated Newton method (Hessian free) for nonlinear
                                optimization with bounds involving a large number of variables.
                                Jacobian necessary
                         - SLSQP: Sequential Least Squares Programming minimization with bounds
                                  and constraints using Jacobian
                         - COBYLA: Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation
                                   (no Jacobian)
                         - NELDER-MEAD: Downhill-simplex search method
                                        (unconstrained, unbounded)
                                        without the need for a Jacobian
                         - POWELL: Powell's conjugate direction method (unconstrained) without
                                   the need for a Jacobian. Minimizes the function by a
                                   bidirectional search along each search vector
        bounds (sequence, Bounds): Bounds on variables for Nelder-Mead, L-BFGS-B, TNC, SLSQP,
                                   Powell, and trust-constr methods.
                                   There are two ways to specify the bounds:

                                   1. Instance of `Bounds` class.
                                   2. A sequence with 2 elements. The first element corresponds
                                   to a sequence of lower bounds and the second element to
                                   sequence of upper bounds. The length of each of the two
                                   subsequences must be equal to the number of variables.
        cons (np.array): Nonlinear constraints for the optimization.
                         Only for COBYLA, SLSQP and trust-constr
                         (see SciPy documentation for details)
        initial_guess (np.array): Initial guess, i.e. start point of
                                  optimization.
        jac_method (str): Method to calculate a finite difference based approximation of the
                          Jacobian matrix:

                          - '2-point': a one-sided scheme by definition
                          - '3-point': more exact but needs twice as many function evaluations
        jac_rel_step (array_like): Relative step size to use for finite difference approximation
                                   of Jacobian matrix. If None (default) then it is selected
                                   automatically. (see SciPy documentation for details)
        max_feval (int): Maximum number of function evaluations.
        result_description (dict): Description of desired post-processing.
        verbose_output (int): Integer encoding which kind of verbose information should be
                              printed by the optimizers.
        precalculated_positions (dict): Dictionary containing precalculated positions and
                                        corresponding model responses.
        solution (np.array): Solution obtained from the optimization process.
        objective_and_jacobian (bool): If true, every time the objective is evaluated also the
                                       jacobian is evaluated. This leads to improved batching, but
                                       can lead to unnecessary evaluations of the jacobian during
                                       line-search. This option is only available for gradient
                                       methods. Default is false.
