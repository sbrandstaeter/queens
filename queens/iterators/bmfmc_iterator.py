class BMFMCIterator(Iterator):
    r"""Iterator for the Bayesian multi-fidelity Monte-Carlo method.

    The iterator fulfills the following tasks:

    1.  Load the low-fidelity Monte Carlo data.
    2.  Based on low-fidelity data, calculate optimal *X_train* to evaluate the high-fidelity model.
    3.  Based on *X_train* return the corresponding *Y_LFs_train*.
    4.  Initialize the *BMFMC_model* (this is not the high-fidelity model but the probabilistic
        mapping) with *X_train* and *Y_LFs_train*. Note that the *BMFMC_model* itself triggers the
        computation of the high-fidelity training data *Y_HF_train*.
    5.  Trigger the evaluation of the *BMFMC_model*. Here evaluation refers to computing the
        posterior statistics of the high-fidelity model. This is implemented in the *BMFMC_model*
        itself.
