    Similar to particles in SMC, we use the approach where a distribution is approximated as
    particles:

      - The particles are the events of the sample space
      - The weights are denoted by the probabilities of the events

    This class can be used directly, but is also used as parent class for other 1d discrete
    distributions as the computation of expectations is done in the same fashion.

    Attributes:
        mean (np.ndarray): Mean of the distribution
        covariance (np.ndarray): Covariance of the distribution
        dimension (int): Dimensionality of the distribution
        probabilities (np.ndarray): Probabilities associated to all the events in the sample space
        sample_space (np.ndarray): Samples, i.e. possible outcomes of sampling the distribution
