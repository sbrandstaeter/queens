    Provides basic functionality for extracting data from txt files,

    Attributes:
        The implementation of the filter_and_manipulate_raw_data method is up to the user.

    Throws:
        MemoryError: We throw a conservative MemoryError if the txt file is larger than 200 MB.
        This is due to the current design, which loads the entire content of the
        .txt file into memory.

    Potential Improvement:
        Use a generator for reading the content of the file in chunks.
        This however requires a more advanced logic with the possibility to nest functions
        calls in a flexible way.
