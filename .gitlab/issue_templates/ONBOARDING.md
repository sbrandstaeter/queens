## Welcome to the QUEENS team!

We're happy to have you onboard and created this onboarding issue to get you started. Its main purpose is to guide you through your first steps and introduce you to other developers working on similar topics. Take your time to work through the checklist below and tell us a little bit about yourself by filling the following introduction section (click on the pencil symbol above to edit this description). Finally, please let us know if you have any ideas on how to improve this onboarding procedure and the provided documentation.

However, to give you some inspiration, here is a list of things that might be of interest to others:
